# Productivity App

This is a React and NodeJs task management and bug tracking app. It has features that make it possible for a team to collaborate on tasks or solve issues, such as a calendar, a Kanban board, and a dashboard.


## Features
Task Management feature. This feature enables one to create a task, and if necessary, assign the task to a team member. Tasks are categorized as "To Do", "In Progress" or "Done". A user can also mark a project as complete in order to clear it from the visual board.


Bug tracking feature. This feature is similar to the task management feature. A developer can create a ticket with information on the identified bug, such as the title, description, steps taken to detect the bug, and its severity. A developer or product manager can then proceed to assign the best person to solve the issue.


Kanban Board. Both the task management and bug tracking functionalities use a visual Kanban Board. The board has a drag-and-drop functionality which makes tracking easy and fun.


Calendar. After creating tasks, you can assign them the expected duration to completion by specifying the start and the end date. One can view all their tasks on the calendar. The calendar has a month, week, or daily view. The month, week, and daily views display all the tasks in a given month, week, or day respectively.
